# Make the NVIDIA CDI specs parseable by podman 4.9.3 (Ubuntu noble / Mint 22).
#
# nvidia-ctk >= 1.17 emits CDI spec version 0.7.0 with an `additionalGids` field on each
# device. podman 4.9.3 bundles container-device-interface 0.6.x, which rejects the whole spec:
#
#   failed to parse CDI Spec "/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml": json: unknown field "additionalGids"
#   Error: setting up CDI devices: unresolvable CDI devices nvidia.com/gpu=all
#
# The field only matters when the container process runs as a non-root user that needs
# supplementary groups for /dev/nvidia*; the MCS image runs as root, so dropping it costs
# nothing. Downgrade the declared version to 0.6.0 to match.
#
# Must run as root (the specs are root-owned). Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
# RE-RUN THIS after an NVIDIA driver or container-toolkit upgrade: nvidia-cdi-refresh.path
# regenerates /var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml (and `nvidia-ctk cdi generate` rewrites /etc/cdi),
# both of which reintroduce the field.
