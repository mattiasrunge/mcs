"""`inference_ops.transcribe` with the whisper model stubbed: the per-request overrides reach the
decode call and the signature, and the configured values apply when a request names none.

This is the test that would have caught the shadowed-local bug the first fry2 transcription
found: the decode call is exercised for real, only the model behind it is fake.

The language half: detection runs over several windows and the expected languages win when
they reach the floor, what was chosen is what the decoder is told, and a pin skips detection.
