"""ImageMagick for renditions: one decode, every output cloned from it.

The pipeline is the one MURRiX's derivative ladder was measured into shape with, argument for
argument, so a rendition made here is byte-identical to one it made itself with the same
ImageMagick:

    magick SOURCE -set option:filter:blur 0.8 -filter Lagrange -strip -orient Undefined
      [-rotate -A +repage] [-flop +repage]
      ( +clone [-crop …] <fit> -quality Q -print "N %w %h\\n" -write FMT:TEMP +delete ) …
      -print "frame %w %h\\n" null:

Every output is cloned from the decoded, upright source; no rendition is ever resized from
another rendition. The source is decoded once, which is the point of taking a list.

`-strip` drops the EXIF block but not ImageMagick's own orientation property — it even carries
it through the rotation. The AVIF encoder then writes that as a HEIF `irot` and every decoder
applies it, silently undoing the turn just made (measured: the same chain gave 800x1600 as PNG
and 1600x800 as AVIF). `-orient Undefined` beside `-strip` is what actually clears it.

Crops are cut with `%[fx:…]` geometry, which is why this is `magick` and not the legacy
`convert`: a stored box is a fraction of the display frame, and the fraction is resolved
against the raster ImageMagick actually decoded — the sensor image for a RAW, the turned
raster for a HEIF — rather than against dimensions a caller declared, which for those two
families are not the raster at all. The legacy CLI does not expand escapes in `-crop`.
