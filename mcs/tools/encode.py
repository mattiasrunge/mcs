"""The video transcode, planned: filter chains, the encoder ladder and the CPU decode budget.

Ported from MURRiX's `video-to-video`, whose measurements this keeps. Three stages, each giving
up strictly less of the GPU than the one below it:

1. **Full VRAM** — NVDEC decode, CUDA filters, NVENC encode. Needs transpose_cuda (ffmpeg 9).
2. **CPU decode, GPU encode** — the CPU chain, `hwupload_cuda`, NVENC. Keeps the encoder when
   only the decoder was the problem: NVDEC has no decoder for DV, MJPEG, Indeo or ProRes, a
   quarter of any old archive, and AV1 on the CPU is the expensive half (measured on 20 s of
   720x576 DV: libsvtav1 5.0 s against 1.3 s for a CPU decode feeding NVENC).
3. **All CPU** — libsvtav1.

The CPU decode is what accumulates: RSS grows linearly with the frames pushed through it and is
never given back (measured 2026-08-23, 720x576 DV: 22,500 frames → 3797 MB on stage three,
7,500 → 1254 MB on stage two — 0.17 MB per frame on either, since the decode is the stage they
share). Bounding the encoder's own parallelism does not help (`lp=2` raised peak RSS), nor is
it arena retention (MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2 was inside the noise), so the bound is on the job: the
footprint is projected from the frame count before anything starts, and a source over the
budget is encoded as *windows* — a fresh process per window resets the accumulator — joined by
a stream copy. Only a source whose windows cannot be placed is refused, and a refusal is
permanent for that source at that budget.

`-display_rotation 0` is on every stage, and it is the flag that makes them agree: ffmpeg
autorotates from a container's display matrix by default but skips it when the decoder hands
back hardware frames, so stage one silently did not rotate while the CPU stages did. Not
`-noautorotate`, which suppresses the turn but passes the matrix on to the output for the
browser to apply. The caller's `angle` is the only thing that turns pixels — the same rule as
every other op.
