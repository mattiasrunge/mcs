"""Host-memory diagnostics for the resident model server.

Exists to answer one question: when the server's RSS ratchets up over hours, do the bytes
belong to glibc's allocator or not?

`malloc_trim(0)` (model_registry.cleanup_torch) can only return memory glibc owns. If
`arena + hblkhd` climbs with RSS, something is malloc'd and never freed and the caller is
findable. If glibc's total stays flat while RSS climbs, the bytes belong to an allocator that
mmaps for itself and never gives back — onnxruntime's CPU BFCArena, CUDA pinned host memory,
CTranslate2 — and no amount of trimming will help.

Everything here is best-effort: diagnostics must never take down an inference request, so every
probe returns None rather than raising.
