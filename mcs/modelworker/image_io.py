"""Open an image the models can work with, whatever container it arrived in.

PIL and cv2 between them read a narrower set of formats than the archive holds, and every
caller here routes on the `image/` mimetype prefix — so a camera RAW or an iPhone HEIC used to
travel all the way to the model call before failing, as `cannot identify image file`.

Two packages close it:

  - **pillow-heif** registers a HEIF opener into PIL, so `.heic` behaves like any other file.
  - **rawpy** (LibRaw) reads RAW. `extract_thumb()` returns the embedded full-size JPEG — the
    same image the out-of-process path pulls with `exiftool -b -PreviewImage`, and the one whose
    dimensions already match what `exif-extract` recorded on the node, since that reads the
    File-level dims, which come from the preview rather than the sensor. A full `postprocess()`
    demosaic is the fallback for a RAW that carries no usable preview.

Dispatch is by *failure*, not by extension: PIL is asked first and LibRaw picks up whatever PIL
cannot identify. A format table here would be a second copy of `RAW_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`, in
another language, free to drift.

## The frame, which is not uniform

Measured in the built image, not assumed:

  - **RAW comes back unrotated.** rawpy hands over the embedded preview as stored — a 6032x4032
    RAF opens 1920x1280 landscape, matching the node, despite the file being tagged
    `Rotate 270 CW`.
  - **HEIF comes back rotated.** pillow-heif *is* libheif, and it applies the container's
    `irot`/`imir` on decode: a node recording 4032x3024 opens 3024x4032. It also rewrites the
    EXIF orientation to 1 and keeps no record of what it did — there is no
    `original_orientation`, and no option to turn the transform off.

So HEIF arrives already in the display frame and everything else arrives in the stored frame.
That difference is *not* resolved here, because it cannot be: pillow-heif rewrites the EXIF
orientation to 1 and keeps no record of what it applied, so the rotation it did is unrecoverable
from this side. The caller passes a **residual** angle instead — what the node asks for minus what
the decoder already did, worked out in `@media/decode-image`, which can still read the file's own
tag. In the ordinary case the two agree and the residual is zero; they differ exactly when someone
has corrected a rotation by hand, and then the correction is what survives.
