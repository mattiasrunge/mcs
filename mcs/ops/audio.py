"""`audio.waveform` — a rendered picture of a recording's envelope, fitted like a rendition.

A waveform is drawn, not resized into shape, so each target picks its own drawing box: a
`cover` target is drawn square (it owes its caller a square), any other target is drawn as a
banner `aspect` times wider than tall that fits inside the box. Every picture is drawn at
twice its size and scaled down once: `showwavespic` writes hard per-column pixels with no
antialiasing of its own, and that downscale is the only thing that smooths the envelope.

One ffmpeg decode draws every picture — the audio is split inside the filter graph — and the
decode is the cost: the picture is about a thousand columns wide however long the track is.
`aresample=8000` ahead of the drawing is what makes a thirty-minute recording cheap; at 8 kHz a
column still averages thousands of samples.

`filter=average` with `scale=sqrt`, and deliberately no `compand`: compared on a 31-minute
cassette rip, compand fills the frame with a solid mass (at a second per column the peak is
near maximum everywhere), a linear average barely registers a quiet tape, and a peak filter
comes out hairy. sqrt lifts the quiet passages in the *drawing*, which is where the problem is,
and leaves the loud/quiet contrast that makes a recording recognisable.
